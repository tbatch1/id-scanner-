- If we connect the scanner via **USB** to the iPad: we use the **Apple adapter + powered USB hub**.

## Pricing chart (per station)

Assumptions for “USB totals” below:

- Lightning iPad USB kit = $39.00 (adapter) + $25.99 (hub) = **$64.99**
- USB‑C iPad USB kit = $19.00 (adapter) + $25.99 (hub) = **$44.99**

| Option | Scanner price | Bluetooth total | USB total (Lightning iPad) | USB total (USB‑C iPad) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| NETUM E800 | $119.99 | $119.99 | $184.98 | $164.98 |

| Socket S740 new | $365.00 | $365.00 | $429.99 | $409.99 |

## “Sit there” add-on for Socket (optional)

If you want the scanner to sit upright and be used hands-free, add the Socket stand:

- Socket S740 refurb + refurb stand: $252 + $73 = **$325**  
  https://www.socketmobile.com/products/s740-refurbished

## Notes (keep it simple)

- If you need **2D/QR**, all three options above meet that requirement.
- Cheapest per station is **Eyoyo EY-036 over Bluetooth**.
- Lowest hassle / most “pro” experience on iPad is usually **Socket S740** (especially with the stand), but it costs more.
