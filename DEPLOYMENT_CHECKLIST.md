## ðŸŽ“ CLERK TRAINING

### **Quick Training Script:**

> **"We have a new age verification system. Here's what's different:"**
>
> 1. Ring up items as normal
> 2. When ready to pay, tell customer: "I need to scan your ID"
> 3. Click either:
>    - **"Cash (ID Required)"** for cash payments
>    - **"Card (ID Required)"** for credit/debit
> 4. Scanner pops up â†’ Customer holds ID to iPad camera
> 5. **BEEP!** â†’ Shows verification result
> 6. Wait 2 seconds â†’ Sale completes automatically
> 7. Print/email receipt as normal
>
> **Total time: 5-10 seconds extra per sale**

### **Common Questions:**

**Q: What if customer refuses ID scan?**
A: Cannot complete sale without verification. Explain it's required by law.

**Q: What if scanner doesn't work?**
A: Restart scan button. If still fails, call manager.

**Q: Can I use the old Cash/Card buttons?**
A: No - they've been removed. Only use "(ID Required)" buttons.
