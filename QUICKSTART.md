# âš¡ Quick Start - ID Scanner Integration

## ðŸŽ¯ When You Get API Credentials

**You'll receive from your boss:**
1. Lightspeed API Key (long string of letters/numbers)
2. Lightspeed Account ID (usually 5-6 digits)

---

## ðŸš€ Immediate Steps

### **1. Add Credentials to Vercel (2 minutes)**

Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables

**Add these variables:**
```
LIGHTSPEED_API_KEY = <paste the API key here>
LIGHTSPEED_ACCOUNT_ID = <paste the account ID here>
```

Click **Save** â†’ Click **Redeploy**

âœ… **Done!** The system will automatically switch from mock to real Lightspeed API.

---

### **2. Get Your Vercel URL**

After deployment completes:
- Copy your production URL (looks like: `https://id-scanner-xyz.vercel.app`)
- You'll need this for the custom buttons

---

### **3. Configure Lightspeed Custom Buttons (5 minutes)**

**In Lightspeed Back Office:**
1. Go to: **Settings â†’ Custom Menus â†’ Register: Payment Tab**

2. Click **"Add Button"** and create:

**Button 1:**
```
Label: Cash (ID Required)
Type: Open Web Page
URL: https://YOUR-VERCEL-URL.vercel.app/checkout.html?type=cash&saleId={saleID}&employeeID={employeeID}&accountID={accountID}
```

**Button 2:**
```
Label: Card (ID Required)
Type: Open Web Page
URL: https://YOUR-VERCEL-URL.vercel.app/checkout.html?type=card&saleId={saleID}&employeeID={employeeID}&accountID={accountID}
```

3. **Delete old buttons:**
   - Find "Cash" â†’ Click trash icon â†’ Delete
   - Find "Card" â†’ Click trash icon â†’ Delete

âœ… **Done!** Buttons appear at all 13 locations automatically.

---

### **4. Test It! (2 minutes)**

1. Ring up a test sale in Lightspeed
2. Click "Cash (ID Required)"
3. Scan an ID with iPad camera
4. Watch it auto-complete!

âœ… **If that works, you're ready to go live!**
